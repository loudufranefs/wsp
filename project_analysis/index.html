            <h2>Site Intent</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The primary goal of the site is to give users information about every available method to contact the client, as well as provide users with key information that they may need right away such as location and opening hours. The site also provides users with information about the services that are being offered, and information about the company and the staff.</p>
                <p>The current website does not have an intuitive flow, I feel users will be put off by the disorganization and out-dated design, and will not be able to find information easily, not because the information isn't there, but because it may not be where users would expect it.</p>
                <div class="site_intent_info">
                    <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
                    <p>The content in the current website, although much of the copy can be re-used, the overall content will need to be audited and re-organized. Some copy on some of the pages will be merged with more prominent pages. The main focus here is to increase the chances for users to find the information they are looking for.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="site_intent_info">
                    <h3>User Interface</h3>
                    <p>The current design is not appealing or cohesive, and does not work well for this website. A new visual design will need to be created focusing on the target audience. The new design should be friendly, clean, and give a feeling of trustworthiness or legitimacy. The layout will also be addressed, and new layout will be used to create a better overall flow of content.
